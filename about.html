       <p>
        David Kekich is President/CEO of Maximum Life Foundation that focuses on aging research. He founded the country’s largest life insurance master general agency, co-founded a financial services company and arranged venture capital funding for 16 private companies. He authored the venture capital handbook How the Rich Get Richer with Quiet Private Investments. Mr. Kekich founded three public and five private companies, was engaged as a consultant to 41 private companies and served as director to seven private and four public corporations. He also sold and developed real estate. He appeared in many newspaper and magazine articles as well as on television and starred in and appeared in several documentaries. He authored the popular life extension book, Smart, Strong and Sexy at 100.

        Early in his career, Mr. Kekich realized the inevitability that medical technology will someday control the human aging process. By studying aging, the root cause of most deadly diseases, he understood human beings will someday be able to enjoy very long health spans. The problem? He was in a race against the clock. He was faced with the possibility of being part of the “last generation” to suffer and die from aging related diseases.
        
        His solution? In 1999, he founded “Maximum Life Foundation”, a 501(c)(3) corporation dedicated to finally eliminating the worldwide terror of human aging and aging related diseases. He networked throughout the anti-aging segment of the biotech industry and developed a model to put life sciences aging research on the fast track. The Foundation has developed a scientific roadmap to transform the elderly to biological youth. He now heads an initiative to develop and deploy leading-edge technologies that will accelerate human rejuvenation.
